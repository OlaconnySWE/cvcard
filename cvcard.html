    <main class="about">
        <p>My name is Ryley Robinson, and I am the sole known survivor of the Aurora spacecraft crash on
            Planet 4545B, an uncharted ocean world on the far edge of Alterra space. When the Aurora was struck by an
            unknown energy pulse, I found myself alone, stranded thousands of light-years from home with nothing but a
            damaged life pod and my determination to survive. </p>
        <p>At first, every day was a struggle — food, water, and shelter were immediate challenges. Using
            my fabricator and scavenged materials, I constructed tools, vehicles, and underwater habitats, gradually
            learning to thrive in an alien ecosystem that was as beautiful as it was dangerous. Over time, I uncovered
            fragments of the planets history and discovered the existence of a deadly bacterial infection known as the
            Kharaa. Understanding its origin became my mission.</p>
        <p> Through exploration of deep-sea biomes, alien facilities, and ancient technology, I pieced
            together a cure for the Kharaa and ultimately disabled the quarantine platform that had trapped me there. My
            survival was not only about endurance — it was about discovery, adaptation, and the unbreakable will to
            live.</p>
        <p> I left Planet 4545B alive, carrying with me my pda, with all of the organic knowladge and experiences that reshaped humanitys
            understanding of alien life and survival.</p>
